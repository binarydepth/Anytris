Various means to interpolate between two values (AKA "easing").
<br><br>
The functions provided here interpolate between floating point numbers. If
 you want to interpolate more concrete things, like the position or color of
 an object, or the volume of a sound sample, take a look at module ; it may be just what you need.

<dl><dt><big><a name="Interpolator"></a>alias <u>Interpolator</u> = double delegate(double t);
</big></dt>
<dd>A type representing a function (er, delegate) used to interpolate between two
 values.
<br><br>
The function takes a single parameter, , which is the desired
 "time". It returns the interpolated value at time .
<br><br>

 The  parameter shall normally range between 0 and the requested
 duration. Values out of this range are always acceptable and sometimes have
 useful behavior (for example, passing increasingly larger  values with
 a Sine interpolator produces values oscillating between the two extremes.)
<br><br>

 For most interpolators, the return value will be in the range between the two
 requested extremes as long as  is between zero and the duration. A few
 interpolators, like the Elastic, produces values out of this "expected"
 range. Most interpolators will return values out of the expected range if
 they are passed a  parameter out of the zero-to-duration interval.<br><br>

<dt><big><a name="GenericInterpolatorMakerDelegate_t"></a>alias <u>GenericInterpolatorMakerDelegate_t</u> = double delegate(double t) delegate(double from, double to, double duration);
</big></dt>
<dd>A generic interpolator maker interface (a delegate).
<br><br>
An interpolator maker is a function that returns an .
<br><br>

 All interpolator makers are implemented as functions that have exactly this
 same signature.<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="interpolator"></a>Interpolator <u>interpolator</u>(string type)(double <i>from</i>, double <i>to</i>, double <i>duration</i> = 1.00000);
</big></dt>
<dd>Creates and returns an .
<br><br>
This is <i>the</i> way to create one of the provided interpolators

<br><br>
<b>Parameters:</b><br>
type = This specifies what type of <u>interpolator</u> is desired. The general
       string format should be  (easing in),  (easing out)
       or  (both easing in and out). The exception is the linear
       <u>interpolator</u>, which doesn't accept brackets.  must be replaced
       by the desired <u>interpolator</u> type, which can be , ,
       , , , , , , , , , , , , ,  or . (Notice that many of these are synonyms, like  and
       , or  and .)
    from = The starting interpolation value.
    to = The ending interpolation value.
    duration = The interpolation duration. In other words, the returned
       <u>interpolator</u> will interpolate from  to , as its
       independent parameter varies from  to .<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="interpolatorMaker"></a>GenericInterpolatorMakerDelegate_t <u>interpolatorMaker</u>(string type)();
</big></dt>
<dd>Creates and returns an interpolator maker (that is, a function that can be
 used to create s).
<br><br>
This is <i>the</i> way to create a maker of one of the provided interpolators.

<br><br>
<b>Parameters:</b><br>
type = This specifies what type of interpolator is desired. The possible
       values are the same as in the  function.
