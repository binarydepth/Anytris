#+STARTUP: overview hidestars odd

* Tetris
*** Tetris Wiki
    - [2013-09-06 Fri 10:01] The [[http://tetris.wikia.com/wiki/Tetris_Wiki][Tetris Wiki]] seems to have all
      information I may need.
*** Playfield
    - [2013-09-06 Fri 10:04] Standard playfield is 10 blocks wide and
      at least 20 blocks high. At least two additional block rows
      exists "hiden", over the 20 visible ones. This is the "vanish
      zone".
* Window size
  - [2013-09-06 Fri 11:18] Currently, no decent full screen support in
    FewDee. My Laptop screen is 1280x800. Making the game work in
    1024x768 seems good.
  - [2013-09-06 Fri 11:19] So, blocks of around 20x20 pixels.
  - [2013-09-06 Fri 14:24] Went with blocks of 25x25 pixels to begin
    with.
